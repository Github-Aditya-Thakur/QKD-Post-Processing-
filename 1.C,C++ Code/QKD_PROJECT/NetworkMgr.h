 * Usage:
 * create NetworkMgr, with socketType: 0 undef, 1 client, 2 server
 * Then call setNetworkParam(.) to set parameters.
 * For Server:
 * call bindSocket() to wait for and accept incoming connections
 * 
 * For Client:
 * call connectSocket() to connect to a server
 * 
 * sendData(.) with char array of data, and len=len of array (data)
 * after the call, len will contain the number of sent bytes
 *
 * receiveData(.) with char array as buffer, len must be the buffer length
 * after the call, len will contain the number of received bytes
 *
 * receiveDataOfLen(.) similar to receiveData, but it will keep on calling
 * receiveData until it has received the defined number of bytes
 *
 * Cleanup: closeSocket()
 *
