 * Usage: 
 * One needs to open the device connection: openDev(), then a call to 
 * setDelayAndStart(.) passing an int [5] array (0..3: relative delays, 
 * 4: global delay (max. 2 bytes)) will set the delays and start the
 * device.
 * A single call to getData will collect one set of data.
 *
 * If a key queue is set (setQueue(.)) then a separate thread can be
 * started to collect data and put it into the queue
 * startDataCollectThread()
 * 
 * For cleanup one should stop the thread by stopDataCollectThread(),
 * stop the device by calling stop() and then close the device
 * connection with closeDev()
