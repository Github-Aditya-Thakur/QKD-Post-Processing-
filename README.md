# I. Introduction
This project focuses on **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)**, a method for secure key sharing immune to quantum attacks. The raw key from a QKD system contains errors and redundancy, requiring post-processing steps: **Sifting**, **Error Estimation**, **Error Correction**, and **Privacy Amplification (PA)**.

The algorithms for **Sifting** and **PA** were first implemented and tested in **C/C++**, allowing rapid prototyping and functional simulation. After verifying correctness, the design was migrated to hardware using **Verilog HDL** and tested on **Xilinx Vivado**, achieving real-time performance with low latency.

This work demonstrates the transition from **software simulation** to **digital VLSI implementation**, providing an efficient and scalable solution for secure quantum communication.


## What is QKD?

**Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)** is a method for generating and securely sharing a cryptographic key between two parties, traditionally called **Alice** (sender) and **Bob** (receiver), using the principles of quantum mechanics.  

Unlike classical key exchange protocols (e.g., RSA or Diffie-Hellman), QKD is theoretically unbreakable due to the **no-cloning theorem** and **quantum uncertainty**.

The most common protocol is **BB84**, where photons are encoded with quantum states (polarizations), and measurement outcomes depend on the chosen basis.

**Example:**
- Alice sends quantum bits (**qubits**) encoded in random bases.  
- Bob measures these qubits in random bases.  
- Only when their bases match do they keep the result, forming the **sifted key**.

## II. Major Steps in QKD Post-Processing

The standard post-processing pipeline in most QKD protocols consists of:

1. **Sifting**  
   Keep only the bits where Alice's and Bob's measurement bases match, forming the **sifted key**.

2. **Parameter Estimation / QBER Calculation**  
   Estimate the **Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER)** to assess the level of eavesdropping or channel noise.

3. **Error Correction (Information Reconciliation)**  
   Correct errors in the sifted key due to channel noise or imperfections in photon transmission.

4. **Privacy Amplification (Toeplitz matrix)**  
   Compress the corrected key using universal hashing techniques to produce a **final secure key**, removing any partial information an eavesdropper may have.

## QKD Post-Processing Workflow

The following figure illustrates the post-processing steps in a typical QKD protocol, showing the flow from quantum transmission to the final secure key:

# ‚ö° Hardware (Verilog) Implementation of QKD Sifting

### A. Sifting Block in QKD Systems
In a Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) system, **sifting** is the first and most fundamental post-processing step performed after quantum transmission of photons. Its goal is to keep only those bits where **Alice and Bob used the same basis**, forming the **sifted key**.

---

### I. Why Sifting is Needed?
- In BB84, Alice and Bob randomly select measurement bases (+ or √ó).  
- Only when their bases match, the measured bit is meaningful.  
- Mismatched basis measurements are discarded.  
- Output: **Shorter but more reliable key**.  

**Example Table:**

| Photon Index | Alice Basis | Bob Basis | Keep Bit? | Alice Bit | Bob Bit |
|--------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| 1            | +           | +         | ‚úÖ Yes    | 1         | 1       |
| 2            | +           | √ó         | ‚ùå No     | 0         | 0       |
| 3            | √ó           | √ó         | ‚úÖ Yes    | 1         | 1       |
| 4            | √ó           | +         | ‚ùå No     | 0         | 1       |

üëâ **Sifted Key = {1, 1}**

### II. Hardware Implementation (Verilog)

To enable **real-time high-throughput QKD**, sifting is implemented in hardware (FPGA/ASIC).  

**Objectives of Hardware Block**:
- Compare Alice & Bob‚Äôs bases.  
- Store only matching bits in memory.  
- Count matches until a target length (e.g., 10 bits).  
- Compute QBER (errors in matched bits).

# üîê Privacy Amplification (PA) Block in QKD Systems

### 1. Introduction
In **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)**, even after error correction, the shared secret key might partially leak information to an eavesdropper (Eve).  
**Privacy Amplification (PA)** is the final post-processing step, ensuring that the final key is **shorter but information-theoretically secure**.

**Goal:** Compress the corrected key so that even if Eve has partial knowledge, the final key appears *completely random* to her.

---

### 2. Motivation for Privacy Amplification
- Quantum noise & hardware imperfections may leak info.  
- Eve could intercept & resend photons (causing QBER).  
- Error correction leaks parity bits during reconciliation.  

**PA ensures:**
- Removal of Eve‚Äôs knowledge  
- Perfect secrecy of the final key  

---

### 3. Working Principle
PA uses **universal hash functions** to compress the key.

üîπ **Formula:**  
If  
- `K` = input key (length n)  
- `H(K)` = entropy of the key  
- `l` = final key length  
- `Œµ` = security parameter  

Then:  
l ‚â§ H(K) ‚àí 2*log2(1/Œµ)

---


üîπ **Methods Used:**  
- Toeplitz matrices  
- Universal Hash Functions (MMH-MH)  
- Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) for fast modular arithmetic  

---

### 4. Hardware Implementation Overview
To achieve real-time performance, PA is implemented in **FPGA/ASIC**.  

**Main Components:**
- Input Buffer (corrected key storage)  
- Seed Generator (random seeds for hash)  
- Universal Hash Core (NTT-based polynomial multiplication)  
- Compression Logic (shortens key based on QBER)  
- Output Register (final secure key)  

---

### 5. Optimizations
- Barrett or Montgomery modular reduction  
- Parallel butterfly units in NTT  
- Bit-slicing & pipelining for speed
