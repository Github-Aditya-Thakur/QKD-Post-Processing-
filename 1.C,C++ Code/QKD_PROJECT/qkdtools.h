 * Usage:
 * call optimizeGlobalDelay(.) with handle if device connection is already
 * open, with int [5] array (0..3 local delays, have to be set!)
 * and a delay guess.
 * It will test [guess-5, guess+5] to find optimal delay configuration
 * The global delay which results in the highest ratio of ok events to total 
 * events recorded by the device will be returned.
