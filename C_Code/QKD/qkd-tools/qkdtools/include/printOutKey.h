 * Usage:
 * To create a printOutKey object one needs to pass a filename for the output file
 * as well as a key queue to take the key data from.
 * The thread can be started: startPrintOut() and
 * stopped: stopPrintOut() while at the end (cleanup) one should call
 * closeFile() to close the resulting output file.
