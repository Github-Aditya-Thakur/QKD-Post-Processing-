// fpgaIO.h : FPGA-based Fast Multisource Pulse Registration System 
// Simple Labview Driver
// Copyright by Sergey Polyakov

// Modified by Pascal Notz, 2012
// 
// Simple FPGA-USB-Interface, defining:
//
// HANDLE fpgaIO::FPGA_Open()
//		returns an integer "handle" to the device. -1 if not successful.
//
// void fpgaIO::FPGA_Close(HANDLE XyloDeviceHandle)
//		Closes communication session.
//
// int fpgaIO::FPGA_Interface (HANDLE XyloDeviceHandle, unsigned char * fpga_command, unsigned char *buffer, int &bufferLength)
//		establishes the communication with the FPGA and returns data.
//				HANDLE XyloDeviceHandle: handle to FPGA device
//              char fpga_command: array of up to 6 bytes to send to FPGA. 
//					Possible commands: 00000000 no command
//									   00000001 clear timestamping counter (same as start)
//									   00000010 stop aquisition
//									   00000100 start aquisition
//									   10000111 set delay, 7 in this case (need to have 6 bytes in a row to set all delays)
//				unsigned char* buffer: needs to be an array of 65536 bytes length
//				int &bufferLength: will contain the number of Bytes received from FPGA
//		returns 1 if successful, 0 upon an error
//
// The computer communicates with the FPGA via a USB 2 port and using a standard ezusb driver.
// The FPGA is a slave USB device. The protocol consists of 
// 1) a request sent by a computer (sends one byte via FIFO2, which is used for a primitive control of FPGA, see documentation)
// 2) a response of FPGA (replies with 2 bytes via FIFO5, reports the length of collected information in bytes)
// 3) data of a total length reported in step 2 is then availible for download via FIFO4
